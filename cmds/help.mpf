# MbConsole Help Menu

	Welcome to MbConsole. MbConsole is a powerful console engine built on the MyBash console, allowing builtin commands and prompts
	We are always working on improving your experience! visit https://www.mybutton.org/ for our projects.


** Commands **
~ log X		Logs X to the console.
~ cd  X		Changes the current directory to X.
~ . 			Executes the last command again.
~ clear 		Clears the Console Output Screen.
~ exec X		Executes the Script X.
~ account 		Shows the variables in config.lmf
~ var X=Y 		sets the variable X to the value Y.
~ err_message X Shows the ERRORBOX with the message X.
~ restart 		Restarts the Console.
~ quit 		Quits the Console.

** CONFIGURATIONS **
Configurations are stored in ~\config.lmf. To create a config file, create a file and name it config.lmf. Then, edit it with notepad and add the values of variables you'd like.
An example would be:
	my_name=MbConsole Application
	my_future_job=Programmer
These variables are always stored in the console variable list. They do not reset at quit/restart. 

** ALIASES **
MbConsole supports aliases that execute other commands. To Create an alias config file, create a file named alias.lmf and edit it notepad. 
The syntax is like this:
	"command_name": "commands to execute"

Aliases are not executed as normal commands. an alias has $. before the command.
An example:
	"test": "echo this is a test command."

	when we execute 'test' on the console, this happens:
		Console returned null (err_unknown_cmd)
	but, if we execute '$.test', this will occur:
		this is a test command.
	Aliases have $. before them.


** SCRIPTS **
MbConsole also supports scripts. to create one, create a file with the extension .mbs. (if you want to create a script named APP, you'd make the name APP.mbs.)
Edit it with notepad and add the commands you want to execute.
	An example:
		log hello, this is the script APP. 
		log APP is a test script.
		// this is a comment, it will be ignored.
		; this is also a comment, it will be ignored too.
		''' this is also a comment, and it will be ignored. Though, this one needs ''' at the end of the comment '''
		;quitScript()
			// that is a script command.
To execute this script, type 'exec YOUR_SCRIPT_NAME.mbs' and it will run on the console.
